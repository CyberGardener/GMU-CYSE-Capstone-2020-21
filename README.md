# GMU-CYSE-Capstone-2020-21


Anomaly detection analysis was the subject of the proposed project. The desired deliverable was an integrated product that included 
a) algorithm for analyzing relevant data, 
b) dashboard for visualization of the analytic results, 
c) modeling documentation and user manual, 
d) technical demo of the integrated capability. 

Dashboard, the primary output for this project, has the capability to display the following: 
  - Raw data input  
  - Visualizations for the output 
  - Capability to trigger alerts for a SOC analyst with a follow up action (i.e. analytic results to include recommended mitigations, e.g. close the port, disable the user account, quarantine the server, etc.)
